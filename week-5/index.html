<p>
  This is a super simple python CGI server. This page is rendered from a single HTML file with no CSS. <br>
  When you enter text into the name field below, the client will use the HTML POST method to send that text back the server. <br>
  The server will then call a python script which access the text, parses it, and sends a response as HTML, which the browser then renders.

  <input type="text" id="Name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Send">
